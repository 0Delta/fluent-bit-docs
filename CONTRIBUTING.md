# Contributing to Fluent Bit docs

First of all, thanks for taking the time to read this guide. The fact that you're
here means you're interested in contributing to Fluent Bit, and we highly appreciate
your time.

This repository contains the files for the
[Fluent Bit documentation library](https://docs.fluentbit.io/). Keeping these docs
separate from from the [main Fluent Bit repository](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit)
helps reduce the number of commits to the Fluent Bit source code and makes it
easier to maintain both projects.

Fluent Bit has a group of dedicated maintainers who oversee this repository,
including several technical writers. These writers will review any pull requests
you open, so don't be afraid to contributeâ€”even if you're not a writer by trade,
your suggestions are valuable, and we'll help you wrangle any stray commas.

## GitBook

The Fluent Bit docs library is built and hosted through
[GitBook](https://docs.gitbook.com/). Unfortunately, GitBook doesn't support
local previews for contributors, but a Fluent Bit maintainer with a dedicated GitBook
account can verify that things are formatted correctly after you open a new pull
request.

Each `.md` file in this repository is a single page. You can use
[standard Markdown syntax](https://docs.gitbook.com/content-editor/editing-content/markdown)
to edit existing pages, or create a new `.md` file to add an additional page to
the docs library. If you create a new page, you'll also need to update
[GitBook's `SUMMARY.md` file](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/git-sync/content-configuration#structure)
(or ask a maintainer to update it for you).

## Workflow

After you open a pull request in this repo, a Fluent Bit maintainer will review
it, triage it, add comments or suggestions as needed, and then merge it. After
your changes are successfully merged into `master`, the docs site will update
within a few minutes.

### Stale pull requests

If you open a pull request that requires ongoing discussion or review, the
Fluent Bit maintainers will add a [`waiting-for-user` tag](#tags) to your pull
request. This tag means that we're blocked from moving forward until you reply;
to keep contributions from going stale, we'll wait [three weeks?] for your response,
and close the pull request if we don't hear back from you.

### Labels

We use the following labels to categorize pull requests:

The Fluent Bit docs repository uses labels to categorize pull requests. If you
open a new pull request,

- **bug:** This pull request addresses a bug.
- **conflict:** This pull request has a conflict that you need to fix.
- **dependencies:** This pull request updates a

## Submit a contribution

All contributions must be made **first** against [master branch](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-docs/tree/master) which is the active development branch, and then **if** the contribution also applies for the current stable branch, submit another PR for that specific branch, if submitting another PR adds some complexity, please specify in the first PR as a comment (for master branch) that it needs to be *backported*. One of our maintainers will take care of that process.

As a contributor, we'll ask you to follow a few best practices related to Git:

### Commit subjects

The subject must be representative enough to describe which `file` or `interface` is modifying when committing your changes. An everyday use case or example is:

- User is enhancing the documentation for the Syslog output plugin

Considering that Syslog output plugin documentation resides in this address:

- [pipeline/outputs/syslog.md](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-docs/blob/master/pipeline/outputs/syslog.md)

the suggested commit will be:

```
pipeline: outputs: syslog: fix grammar in examples
```

As you can see, the commit is prefixed with the paths of the file being modified. For maintainers, this helps to understand and prioritize the review of the contributions.

Usually, a PR can have multiple commits, but we enforce that every commit only touches one file or interface (we apply the same practice in Fluent Bit source code).

### Set your email in Git

Make sure your email address is configured in your local Git environment. This
should be the same email address associated with your GitHub account.

For more information, refer to GitHub's guide to
[setting your committ email address in Git](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git).

### Sign off your commits

Your commits must be **signed off**; this certifies who is the author of the commit. It might sound a bit redundant, but it is needed. If you don't sign-off your commits, our CI system will flag the PR with a [DCO](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/developer-community/fix-DCO.md) error and the PR will be blocked.

The following link explains how to fix DCO error by signing your commits properly:

- https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/developer-community/fix-DCO.md

For short: always use `-s` when committing your changes, e.g.:

```
git commit -a -s -m "pipeline: outputs: syslog: fix grammar in examples"
```

## Style guidelines

The Fluent Bit maintainers refer to the
[Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)
for most topics related to grammar, style, and formatting. We don't expect you
to memorize these style rules, but the technical writer who reviews your pull
request may suggest changes accordingly.

### Line wrap

[TBD]

### Vale

The Fluent Bit maintainers are working to add a [Vale](https://vale.sh/docs/) plugin
to this repository, which will automatically lint pull requests and add
suggestions to improve style and clarity.
