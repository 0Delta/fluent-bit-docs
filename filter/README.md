# Filter Plugins

The _filter plugins_ allows to __alter__ the incoming data generated by the _input plugins_. As of this version the following filter plugins are available:

| name                        |  title             | description     |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| [grep](grep.md)          | Grep | Match or exclude specific records by patterns |
| [kubernetes](forward.md) | Kubernetes | Enrich logs with Kubernetes Metadata. |
| [stdout](stdout.md)      | Stdout | Print records to the standard output interface. |

In order to let a Filter be applied over some data, the __Match__ rule must exists and it must match the Tag for the incoming data.
