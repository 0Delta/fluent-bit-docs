# Filter Plugins

The _filter plugins_ allows to **alter** the incoming data generated by the _input plugins_. As of this version the following filter plugins are available:

| name | title | description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [grep](grep.md) | Grep | Match or exclude specific records by patterns |
| [kubernetes](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-docs/tree/d5ad35392abae975932c9db0028ce78fe5161b19/filter/forward.md) | Kubernetes | Enrich logs with Kubernetes Metadata. |
| [stdout](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit-docs/tree/d5ad35392abae975932c9db0028ce78fe5161b19/filter/stdout.md) | Stdout | Print records to the standard output interface. |

In order to let a Filter be applied over some data, the **Match** rule must exists and it must match the Tag for the incoming data.
